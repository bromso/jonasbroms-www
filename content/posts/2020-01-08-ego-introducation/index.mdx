### Upbringing & Family
I was brought up in a lower working class area in Gothenburg, Sweden. There is much to be said about this so I think I will save that for a another blog post when I feel ready to share it.
Both my parents were together and still is.
My mom comes from a very creative background. She grew up dancing, creating music and painting. She also worked with kids at a daycare/preschool.
My dad worked a lot because he was the bread winner in the family.
So as a result of all of the above, I was put into a very creative & pedagogical space right from the start, with my mom as my creative mentor.
I also have a little brother that is 4 years younger than me.

### The dream carrier choice as a kid
Growing up, from a early age, I fell in love with video games, graphical design, & 3D animation within the digital hemisphere.
I got access to computers from a very early age, an Amiga 500+ with extra RAM memory and a extra floppy disk. The computer became like a magicians toy box were creative mistakes could just be undone as easy as clicking a button.
I think this was when I really decided that I want to work with creating applications, movies & games in a digital format. And I wanted to do it as a designer, because in my mind at that time, thought, were the coolest people on the planet. And I wanted to be one of those cool cats.

### Bullying, Violence & Fighting
I was quite a proud kid growing up. Me being proud got me into a lot of trouble, because I couldn't stand injustices to be served towards me or others. And as a kid, that makes you an easy target for bullying.
So other kids liked teasing & bullying me. Especially for my last name, that you could easily remake into not so flattering words in Swedish.
Kid = Being Proud + Bullying = Schoolyard Fighting.
I think I will circle back to this topic several times during this blogs lifespan.

### What I loved as a kid
* Basketball
* Greco-Roman Style Wrestling
* Photoshop
* Programming
* Playing video games
* LAN-parties

### Except from work, what've I done in my life?
I've had a two long relationship with two different women.

The last one I married.
She surpasses the carton character Wonderwomen by far on any metric. She is funny, smart, strong, gorgeous, reflecting, supportive... Man, I don't know what I've done to deserve her company. But she makes me wanna be a better man and I will try to live by that emotion and make it to my creed.

I've traveled a lot. I've traveled thru all of Europe. I've driven a car from San Franscisco to New York by my self. I've lived in the poor and rural areas in the Phillipines.
I've lived in Dubai for app. 3 years.
I am currently living in Cyrus since 4 years back.

I've been blessed and cursed to have an entreprenarial spritit. As a result of that I've started several companies. Non of them have been a real success measured from a financial perspective. Measured from a learning and personal growth perspective, they have been VERY rich.

### Today
- I'm dealing with a really rough depression that has been ongoing for app. 10 years back. But for the last 2-3 years, I've been loosing the battle.
- As of a result, I've been unemployed.
- I've become quite obese.
- I've been alone with more or less no contact from friends or co-workers during this unemployed timeframe.

### Plans for the future?
- I am going to do a redemption tour from the last couple of years.
- I am going to aquire more meaningful relationships in my life.
- I am going to succeed financially with my business endevours.
- I am going to aquire more joy and happiness, like I did when I was young.
- I am going to become a vital provider to my social sourrandings of joy, happiness, creaing purpose and meaning so when the existiential darkness hits mine or their human vehicle. That stress and anxiety isn't the to only harbours that have a place to park their boat in. My cozy living room, my guest room could also be mine and theirs salvation spots.

I don't know how to achieve this as of right now. That feeling of not knowing sometimes gives me anxiety. But I do know that my life continueation is depending that I move in the direction outlined in the bullet points above. Because I've been on the other spectrum... And it only leads to darkness, in both feelings and thoughts.
