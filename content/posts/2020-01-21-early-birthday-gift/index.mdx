I'm so super grateful right now!
Just received an early birthday gift from my lovely mom & dad. Tickets to [Björn Natthiko Lindeblad](https://natthiko.se/) at Folkets Hus, Stockholm. A person that I've never met but I'm so grateful that I found, when my existential skiff was at REALLY rough seas in the middle of the artic night. A philosophical penguin buddy that can dance to the silent groove of the northern lights.

He is a former Financial controller/Manager at one of the biggest industrial companies in Sweden that became a Thai buddhist monk for 17 years.

He has moved back to Sweden and is today a Public speaker, Meditation teacher, [Podcaster](https://www.facebook.com/bjornochnavid/) & a Fellow human being.
