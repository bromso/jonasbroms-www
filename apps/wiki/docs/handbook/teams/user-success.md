## Manifesto

### Mission

In a nutshell, the mission of the BrandX Marketing team is to scale our brand awareness and the acquisition of users, contributors, and prospects worldwide.

### Guiding principles

As sponsors of the BrandX Open Source project, we fundamentally believe that Community-Led Growth is the most suited go-to-market motion for BrandX.

It means that we intentionally accept to lose some control over our brand narrative and invest resources to build a vibrant and diverse community of users/contributors.

To that end, we invest a lot of effort into creating educational content such as tutorials, guides, how-to videos to help users learn about BrandX best practices.

## Values

### How your team embodies the BrandX values?

- **Controlled ambition:** The Marketing team is ambitious. We aim to be the fastest-growing CMS loved by both developers and content teams.
- **Genuine humility:** We take on new challenges with an open mind asking for expert guidance when needed. We believe in collaborative intelligence and are not afraid to say I don't know, ask questions, or for feedback.
- **Proactive Responsibility:** We own our failures and our wins. We don't point fingers, we don't wear blinkers. We are always proactive in finding solutions instead of raising issues.
- **Rational transparency:** Open source is in the DNA of BrandX. We follow an open by default, closed when necessary (legal or security reasons) principle.
- **Active care:** Care is the compass of our attitude. We take care of our mental health and of our team members. Personal ego and hierarchical pressure don't have room in the marketing team. We work as a team, fail as a team and succeed as a team. We don't hustle, we work smart. We listen to our body, our feelings, and our team member's needs.

## How The Team Works

### Team structure

At the moment, the team is organized around 3 pillars:

- **Growth Team:** From traffic acquisition to lead / demand generation and many, the growth team continuously runs new experiments to optimize the conversions at every stage of the marketing and sales funnel.
- **Corporate Marketing:** The corporate marketing team's mission is to define, protect and promote BrandX’s brand and reputation as well as our product positioning and messaging. Through brand programs, product collaterals, and digital/narrative experiences, their role is to express BrandX’s values in action across our audience and ecosystem.
- **Developer Relations:** In collaboration with all other departments, the Developer Relations team is in charge of engaging developers through tutorials, speaking engagements, and community programs to help users understand BrandX’s benefits and value proposition.

### Team cadence

Here is the list of team meetings, events, and rituals we have in the marketing team:

#### Management:

- **Weekly 1-1:** Every member of the team has a weekly 1-1 with their manager.
- **Monthly 1-1:** Every member of the team has a monthly 1-1 with their manager to discuss their professional development plan.
- **Quarterly meeting:** Every member of the team has a quarterly 1-1 focused on performance.

#### Operations:

- **Weekly Team Meeting:** We host a team-wide meeting every Monday to celebrate achievements, review the KPIs, and share highlights or upcoming deadlines.
- **Monthly Team OKR Review:** We host a team-wide meeting every month to review OKR and initiatives' progress and timelines.
- **Quarterly retrospective:** We take a day or two every quarter to organize workshops and dive deeper into the metrics behind our respective programs or initiatives as a way to inform the strategy for the next quarter.
- **Annual cool down week:** Usually after BrandXConf, we need a week to zoom out of the day-to-day operations and focus on learning, team building, and fun!
