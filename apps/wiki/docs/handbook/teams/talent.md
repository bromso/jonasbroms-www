## Manifesto

### Mission

The Talent Team missions are:

- to grow a healthy team of builders and solution-focused people
- to transparently showcase our unique company personality, culture, values and mission
- to align the global strategy with talent management
- to train and coach hiring managers to offer a great candidate experience

### Guiding principles

Finding exceptional talent is not easy and finding exceptional talent for a fast-growing company is even harder. The Talent Team follows some principles to help find and hire the best people.

- **Diversity and Inclusion:** we are growing a diverse team representative of the users we serve. We are committed to building a safe workplace where everyone feels empowered to be their authentic selves. By being you and bringing your unique difference, perspective, culture, experience, lifestyles, and challenges, you actually help us succeed and grow to be the best version of ourselves.
- **Positive experience:** we believe candidates must have a unique experience, from when they first contact our company to when they feel fully part of the team and beyond.
- **Culture Embeddedness:** culture is to recruiting as product is to marketing. We only want to join with kind, respectful and trustworthy people as we want to share our journey with people that will have our backs no matter what.

## Values

### How does the Talent team embody the BrandX values?

- **Measured ambition:** We aim to hire the best candidates for our teams while ensuring a positive candidate experience and are searching for people aligned with our values and ambitious strategy.
- **Genuine humility:** We constantly review our process and give everyone a second chance. We defined an inclusive process and adapt it to every individual need. We train ourselves constantly and continually ask for feedback from candidates.
- **Proactive Responsibility:** We assist and train hiring managers to build an ambitious hiring plan and proactively look for candidates.
- **Rational transparency:** Open source is our DNA. Our hiring process is public, and our values are too.
- **Active care:** We assess with care and adapt to every individual need.
